## About Us
Aronetics®’ mission is to revolutionize global business cybersecurity teams. We speak IT® and will never stop defending data to secure global enterprises against adversaries. Aronetics’ technology provides a single unlimited purpose-driven design that delivers a multi-service function of information security defense to minimize threats to data and your identity.

## Our Origin
In a nutshell, we've been defending moral ethics of democratic republics. Whether this is a freedom of speech, a freedom of politics or a freedom of economy, our roots are political ethics pertaining to information technology systems. We speak IT® and will not stop defending information technology systems from [Bears](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/russia/) and [Panda Bears](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/china/) and their friends, like Asiatic Lion. 

## About Thor™
[Aronetics](https://www.aronetics.com) is a small entreprise from Ohio within the United States that is solely focused on cybersecurity solutions that support national efforts and partner enterprises. 

At no other point in history have changes in other societies been possible. Unprecedented transformations are already taking place. Thor™ completely minimizes the risks associated with edge devices and provides a game-changing capability for both businesses and governments.

Thor™ represents a complete and necessary paradigm shift across the vast landscape of devices that require protection.

Aronetics® embeds intelligent security directly into the kernel of the operating system to thwart any adversarial attempt to tamper with data from a single, tamper-proof perspective, thereby protecting itself.

Aronetics® redefines security by embedding Zero Trust at the system’s core—utilizing quantum-grade randomness from a high-frequency and non-deterministic codebase to create an impenetrable cryptographic bridge from the kernel module to the Unified External Firmware Interface.

Necessity is the mother of invention — we offer a defensive digital hammer that we call Thor™.

Our repo is private — the technology is export restricted, and no longer here on [GitHub](https://gitlab.com). If you are interested to know more about our technology, [contact us!](https://www.aronetics.com/company/contact/)
